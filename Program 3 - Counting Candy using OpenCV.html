<h1>Counting the Colors of Candy&nbsp;</h1>
<h3>Due March 1st by 5pm&nbsp;- Partners OK, turn in one submission per team, make sure both names are in the comments.&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Teams/Partners can only be teams of two, NEVER MORE, working alone is OK, but max amount of team members will be two.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>TO DO:</h2>
<p>You are to write a OPENCV&nbsp;program with Python that takes still images of candy (M&amp;M, Skittles, Reeses Pieces) and counts the total number of candy, plus will give the count of each color of candy.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h2><strong>Requirements:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Taking in an image of candy (I'll give the images to use) you will use OpenCV to segment out the candy.</li>
<li>You will then take the segmented candies and decipher which color each piece of candy is.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You will then output in the corner of the image how many of each color candy you have.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>Example:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li><em>Green = 5</em></li>
<li><em>Yellow = 3</em></li>
<li><em>Red = 4</em><em></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Advanced you will read in a video of candy's on a moving manufacturing&nbsp;belt and keep track of the count as they enter and exited the screen.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Your code should not have to adjust code to solve the problem on different levels of images.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>You will get easy, medium, harder pictures and then a video</li>
<li>Get easy picture working first.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Then adjust to get medium picture working, when you do it shouldn't break the easy picture.&nbsp;</li>
<li>We will test with easy first, if it doesn't work we will not go on to the&nbsp;medium picture.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>First must work, then medium, then hard, then video in that order without changing code to get them all.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Images:</p>
<p>Images to come shortly. But you can use this one for now, or the other really easy one to start:</p>

<h2>To Turn in:</h2>
<p>Turn in the source code to D2L by 5 pm, March 1st. One submission per team (if a team) both names in comments.&nbsp;</p>
